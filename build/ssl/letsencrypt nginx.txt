Steps to setup SSL using Lets Encrypt, Docker and Nginx

1) create a Nginx container that runs over http. 
Thsi will be used by Cerbot to peformn the challenge request to 
isse the certificate. This basic instance of Nginx will only ever be run for the first time that you request a
certificate from Let's Encrypt.

2) create a cerbot container to run the cerbot command to issue the certificate

Certbot will perform an ACME challenge request to validate that you are in control of your domain.
This happens on the temporary Nginx server we create in step 1

This certificate consists of a private key and a public key and both these keys are saved in a Let's Encrypt folder on your server


3) The certifcate will be saved on a volume on the Ubuntu server (droplet)
and the cerbot container will be shutdown

4) containerize an Nginx server that will load the certs and serve the content over ssl

This prodcution version of the Nginx server configuration file needs to reference both keys in order to configure your site to use HTTPS.

using docker allows us to stay current on udpates to certbot.
2 steps for use/reuse
a) get a  new ssl cert (runs on basic nginx setup in step 1)
b) cron job to run a periodic script to renew (runs on production version setup in in step 4)
